AsyncMailer
==============

Use :async_sendmail or :async_smtp delivery_methods if you want to
send emails in a separate thread from the main thread of execution.
This way the execution won't be blocked if email system is under a
heavy load. It is very important when you send emails from a model
observer which is executed inside of an database transaction.
